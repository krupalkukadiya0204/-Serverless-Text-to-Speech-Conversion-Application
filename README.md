# Serverless-Text-to-Speech-Conversion-Application

### Overview
This project showcases a serverless application that converts text into speech using various AWS services. The application is designed to efficiently synthesize speech in multiple languages and voices, making it suitable for a range of applications, including converting blog posts into audio format.

### Features

Converts text to speech using Amazon Polly
Stores data in Amazon DynamoDB
Utilizes AWS Lambda functions for backend processing
Manages API requests through Amazon API Gateway
Sends notifications using Amazon SNS

### Architecture
The application is built using a serverless architecture, ensuring high availability and scalability without the need for server management.

### Steps to Build the Application

Create an Amazon DynamoDB Table
Set up a DynamoDB table to store text input and metadata.

Create an Amazon API Gateway RESTful API
Configure a RESTful API to manage incoming requests and route them to the appropriate Lambda functions.

Create AWS Lambda Functions
Develop Lambda functions that are triggered by API Gateway events to process text input and convert it to speech.

Integrate Amazon SNS
Connect Lambda functions with Amazon SNS to enable notifications for users when their audio files are ready.

Utilize Amazon Polly
Implement Amazon Polly to synthesize speech in various languages and voices, allowing for diverse output options.

Deploy the Application
Use AWS tools to deploy and test the application, ensuring that it functions correctly in a serverless environment.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need an AWS account and access to the necessary services (DynamoDB, API Gateway, Lambda, SNS, Polly). Follow the steps outlined above to replicate the setup.
